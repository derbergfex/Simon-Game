# Simon-Game

This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code files for 'Build a Simon Game', FreeCodeCamp's last advanced
front-end web development project. The way the game works is that the user is given a series of buttons and a counter.
Each time the user inputs a series of button presses correctly, they can see the same series of button presses but with
an additional step.

There's also a sound associated with each button press. The user is also notified in case they press
the wrong button, and that series of button presses starts again to remind then of the pattern so they can try again.
They user can also see how many steps are in the current series of button presses by looking at the counter.

The user can also play in strict mode where if they get a button press wrong, they are notified that they have done so, 
and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses. The user can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps
correct. The user is notified of victory by the letter "W" showing at the counter, then the game is over.
